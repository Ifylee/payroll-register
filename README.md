# payroll-register

This project is an employee payroll register built for the tracking and management of employee(s) payroll data for proper company budget.

Click on the add employee button to add new employee(s) information. A prompt drop down box will appear with specific questions, there the user inputs employee(s) information. Then user navigates by either choosing "ok" or "cancel". If user chooses "ok", it then asks if the user wants to add another employee? But if user chooses "cancel", the employee(s) data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name.
